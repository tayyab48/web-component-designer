Todo -> unfiy Properties & Attributes.

DesignItem should only store Attributes, not Properties.
Maybe setAttribute should set Attribute directly, setProperty should use PropertiesService??
or do we always use properties PropertiesService?

Attributes List in Properties shows all set attributes and you could also add one,
but they show no binding etc information cause they are only the real attributes

how should we serialize bindings?? if they are binding objects, like in tagbinding?
